TODO / NOTES:
- experiment with variable reduction in null move pruning
- try futility pruning in move skipping section?

-----------------------------------------

- king on open file penalty?
- FIX SEE "BUGS"
- change MOVE_IS_PROMOTION(move), ... to MOVE_TYPE(move) and enumerate PROMOTION_MOVE, ENPASSANT_MOVE, etc.
- stacked rook bonus?
- pawn shield vs piece shield?
- internal iterative deepening (for move ordering)
- experiment with LMR conditions
- move scoring:
  - score promotions?
  - extra score if check? (or maybe search already has that covered)
- experiment with tt structure to reduce size
- should there be a TT update on null move cutoffs?
- question: why does stockfish use depth-limited qsearch?
- when terminating search, should we actually be returning 0?
