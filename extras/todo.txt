TODO:
- implement PV collection using follow_pv and score_pv flags ?
  (random queen sacrifice bug)
- transposition table
- late move reduction
- null move pruning (commented out)
- internal iterative deepening (for move ordering)
- experiment with LMR conditions
- move scoring:
  - score promotions?
  - extra score if check? (or maybe search already has that covered)

TO TRY/RESEARCH:
- lazy SMP
- delta pruning
- futility pruning
- razoring
- reverse futility pruning
- static exchange evaluation pruning
- multi-cut

DONE:
- implement PST
- negamax a/b
- qsearch
- mvv/lva + move ordering
- bishop pair in evaluation
- killer/history heuristics
- iterative deepening
- check extensions
- PVS
- LMR
- aspiration windows

history move heuristic: could take it or leave it
do we need to clear helper tables in search() ?
