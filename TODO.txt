TODO:
- add detailed comments!
- board constructor: parse the last of the FEN string
- add FEN exporter
- make as many functions as possible INLINE and STATIC!
- future: there's no need to update unsafe every time if we store a
  white_attack and black_attack bitboards
- possible: make a table for all (1L << x) instead of calculating them
- replace all magic numbers with defs!
- potential redundancy in undo en passant routine?
- idea for more efficient check-checking: generate all moves from the king and
  bitwise-AND that with the king bitboard
